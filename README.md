## Navigate the Alfresco repository "the easy way"

**Alfresco Website Inventor** is an open-source project that aims to build a fully functional website on top of an Alfresco Share Site.
In that way  you can navigate the repository contents as if it were a website. 
* each folder will be rendered as a webpage (its subfolders will become linked webpages)
* each content of the folder will be shown on the page:
	* txt, html, md are rendered as texts
	* images are shown
	* other file types become downloadable objects

Itâ€™s entirely based on CMIS technology (even if I planned to support the new Alfresco REST API).
